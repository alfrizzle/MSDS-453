This is a challenging yet important field of study for organizations in both public and private sectors. Twitter is a popular platform where entities at all levels—governments, businesses, country leaders, celebrities, and even the average person—express their opinions. The content of such tweets could represent a country's official policy or collectively, a country's public sentiment toward a particular issue. Given the massive volume of tweets generated each day—on average, [6,000 tweets are posted on Twitter every second](https://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/)—there is immense value in being able quickly and accurately determine such sentiment values (e.g., positive or negative). We can use a combination of NLP and machine learning to accomplish this. \n","\n","**Corpus Description**\n","\n","The corpus I will use is Stanford University's [Sentiment140](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip). The dataset is a CSV file consisting of 1.6 million English-language tweets. The tweets are annotated using six attributes: 1. polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive); 2. ID; 3. date; 4. query; 5. username; 6. text. For this project, I will use the polarity and text values to build a classification model that could take any given tweet and determine the most probable sentiment value.\n","\n","**NLP Methods**\n","\n","Given the massive number of documents in the corpus (one tweet = one document), it will be important to ensure the data, particularly each tweet's text, is cleaned and tokenized properly for any follow-on modeling/classification tasks. Regular expressions will be useful in handling any emoticons or special characters (e.g., @ symbols and hashtags). As part of the data exploration step, I could generate histograms and word clouds using various aspects of the tweets (e.g., text content, null values, positive/negative/neutral breakdown, date distribution, etc.) to gain a broad understanding of both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the corpus. \n","\n","With regard to vectorization, I plan to use the methods covered in class thus far, including analyst judgment, TF-IDF, and Doc2vec. Since there are 1.6 million documents, it would be important for me to limit the vocabulary by tuning the vectorizer hyperparameters (e.g., max_features, max_df) and exploring dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA. Finally, I will evaluate the vectors using various classifiers to ensure I have the optimal number of features in training the classification model. I plan to experiment with both traditional classifiers (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, and ensemble methods) and neural networks.\n","\n","The neural net classification models will be built using Keras, primarily for its relatively easy, flexible, and user-friendly syntax. The evaluation method to determine the best classification model could consist of a simple training-and-test regimen within a crossed experimental design. Each model in the experiment would be comparable in terms of vocabulary size and word embeddings. I will likely build the models using the Keras Sequential model that takes the input data (i.e., processed tweet text vectors) through the following layers: a convolutional layer (Conv1D), max pooling (MaxPooling1D) for spatial downsampling, and finally a LSTM to help preserve the learning and error through the various layers. I plan to also plot the learning curves in terms of accuracy for both train/validation datasets to provide a visual representation of the models' performances.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ozN6nbO9tnWX"},"source":["## Data Preparation"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"pKkcBrRNrbvg"},"source":["import pandas as pd  \n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import re\n","import os\n","\n","from google.colab import files\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n","from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n","from collections import Counter\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, CountVectorizer\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","\n","import gensim\n","from gensim.models import Word2Vec\n","from gensim.models.doc2vec import Doc2Vec, TaggedDocument\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from collections import namedtuple\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn import metrics\n","from sklearn import utils\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n","from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","from sklearn.manifold import TSNE\n","\n","from pprint import pprint\n","plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n","\n","%matplotlib inline\n","%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"TWi963IVt1ey","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"outputId":"034a69b9-d945-4761-8491-a4788a8478c2"},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YrzgiFF-5uc1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"outputId":"9762df53-06a0-4737-ef28-27c1bbe431f9"},"source":["!pwd"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/content\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"amerue1o5vo1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"outputId":"be8cb9ac-06a0-4e3e-cfa7-44d45516bcce"},"source":["import os\n","os.chdir('/content/drive/My Drive/MSDS 453/Assignment 4')\n","\n","# Now the directory 'abc' is the current working directory.\n","!ls"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Data\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_wt4iPv4PP0p"},"source":["## EDA"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"y2PuEtQkt3z1"},"source":["cols = ['sentiment','id','date','query','user','text']"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AIw56n03t_3y"},"source":["train_data = '/content/drive/My Drive/MSDS 453/Assignment 4/Data/training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv'\n","df_train = pd.read_csv(train_data, encoding = 'ISO-8859-1', header=None, names=cols)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xb9-Lx_RuKS6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"outputId":"b393b18e-b612-4898-e03f-9bfdaffa3fb7"},"source":["df_train.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>sentiment</th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>date</th>\n","      <th>query</th>\n","      <th>user</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1467810369</td>\n","      <td>Mon Apr 06 22:19:45 PDT 2009</td>\n","      <td>NO_QUERY</td>\n","      <td>_TheSpecialOne_</td>\n","      <td>@switchfoot http://twitpic.com/2y1zl - Awww, t...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1467810672</td>\n","      <td>Mon Apr 06 22:19:49 PDT 2009</td>\n","      <td>NO_QUERY</td>\n","      <td>scotthamilton</td>\n","      <td>is upset that he can't update his Facebook by ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1467810917</td>\n","      <td>Mon Apr 06 22:19:53 PDT 2009</td>\n","      <td>NO_QUERY</td>\n","      <td>mattycus</td>\n","      <td>@Kenichan I dived many times for the ball.
